## IMPORTANT: When `/updike` is invoked directly

When the user types `/updike` without additional context, IMMEDIATELY:

1. **Check platform status** using `check_credentials`
2. **Show this welcome message** with status and options:

```
    __  ______  ____  ______ __ ______
   / / / / __ \/ __ \/  _/ //_// ____/
  / / / / /_/ / / / // // ,<  / __/
 / /_/ / ____/ /_/ // // /| |/ /___
 \____/_/   /_____/___/_/ |_/_____/
```

**Updike ready.** Here's what's live:

| Platform | Status |
|----------|--------|
| X/Twitter | [status from check_credentials] |
| LinkedIn | [status from check_credentials] |
| Instagram | [status from check_credentials] |
| Threads | [status from check_credentials] |

**What do you want to ship?**

Then present these options using AskUserQuestion:

**Question:** "What do you want to do?"
**Options:**
1. **Draft a post** - "I'll search your archive and draft something in your voice"
2. **Post about [topic]** - "Tell me the topic and which platform"
3. **Mine my archive** - "Search 6,600 pieces for content ideas"
4. **Create visuals** - "Quote cards, carousels, branded images"

---

## Content Archive

~6,600 pieces indexed in Pinecone:
- 6,519 tweets (viral hits and everyday thoughts)
- 36 newsletters from neverenough.com
- 21 book chapters from Never Enough
- 16 YouTube transcripts

**Platform Status:** Check with `check_credentials` for live status
- X/Twitter: OAuth 2.0 with auto-refresh
- LinkedIn: Token-based (check expiry)
- Instagram: Requires image with every post
- Threads: Text-based posting

**Generated Content:**
- Images: `~/.updike/generated/images/`
- Audio: `~/.updike/generated/audio/`

---

## CRITICAL: Sorting Content by Date

**NEVER trust filename dates.** Filenames often reflect ingestion date, not publish date.

When asked for "most recent" or "last N" pieces of content:

1. **Read the frontmatter** of each file to get the actual `date` field
2. **Sort by the `date` field**, not the filename
3. **Show the actual publish dates** when presenting results

Example workflow for "review my last 3 newsletters":
```
1. Glob for all newsletters: ~/.updike/content/newsletters/*.md
2. Read frontmatter from each to extract `date` field
3. Sort by date descending
4. Pick the top 3 by actual publish date
5. Present with dates: "Newsletter from Dec 31, 2024: 'Are you insane?'"
```

**Content file frontmatter format:**
```yaml
---
title: "Newsletter title"
date: 2024-12-31        # <-- THIS is the real publish date
slug: newsletter-slug
source_url: https://...
---
```

## Automation Server (Mac Studio)

**All posting now executes on the Mac Studio automation-server** instead of locally. This ensures posts happen reliably, even when MacBooks are closed.

### How It Works

1. **Content generation stays local** - Voice matching, image generation (Gemini), archive search (Pinecone)
2. **Posting executes remotely** - Mac Studio runs the actual API calls
3. **Git as the queue** - Automations are TypeScript files pushed to GitHub

### Posting Workflow

When the user wants to post content:

#### Immediate Posts

1. Generate and validate content as usual
2. Generate image if needed (local Gemini → R2 → public URL)
3. Trigger the automation on Mac Studio:

```bash
# Use the automation-server MCP tools if available
run_automation("updike-post-twitter", { text: "...", image_url: "..." })

# Or via HTTP API
curl -X POST "http://mac-studio.local:3847/api/automations/updike-post-twitter/run" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"triggerData": {"text": "Hello world!", "image_url": "https://pub-updike.r2.dev/..."}}'
```

4. Report to user: "Posted via automation-server" with the post URL

#### Scheduled Posts

For scheduled posts, create a cron-triggered automation file:

1. Generate the automation file locally:

```typescript
// ~/automation-server/automations/updike-scheduled-{uuid}.ts
import type { Context } from "../lib/types";

export const config = {
  name: "updike-scheduled-{uuid}",
  description: "Scheduled: {preview}...",
  trigger: {
    type: "cron" as const,
    schedule: "0 9 25 1 *",  // 9:00 AM on Jan 25
    timezone: "America/Vancouver",
  },
  timeout: 60000,
  retry: { attempts: 3, backoff: "exponential" as const, initialDelay: 5000 },
  enabled: true,
};

export async function run(ctx: Context): Promise<void> {
  // Import the platform automation
  const { run: postToTwitter } = await import("./updike-post-twitter");
  await postToTwitter({ ...ctx, triggerData: { text: "..." } } as Context);
}
```

2. Push to automation-server repo:

```bash
cd ~/automation-server
git pull origin main
git add automations/updike-scheduled-*.ts
git commit -m "Schedule post for Jan 25 9am"
git push origin main
```

3. Mac Studio syncs every 30 minutes and picks up the new automation
4. Report to user: "Scheduled for [time]. Mac Studio will execute automatically."

#### Cross-Platform Posts

Create separate automation calls for each platform. This handles partial failures gracefully.

```bash
# Post to both Twitter and LinkedIn
run_automation("updike-post-twitter", { text: "..." })
run_automation("updike-post-linkedin", { text: "..." })
```

### Available Automations

| Automation | Platform | Trigger Data |
|------------|----------|--------------|
| `updike-post-twitter` | Twitter/X | `{ text, image_url? }` |
| `updike-post-linkedin` | LinkedIn | `{ text, image_url? }` |
| `updike-post-instagram` | Instagram | `{ text, image_url }` (image required) |
| `updike-post-threads` | Threads | `{ text, image_url? }` |

### Checking Status

```bash
# List all automations
curl http://mac-studio.local:3847/api/automations

# Check recent jobs
curl http://mac-studio.local:3847/api/jobs

# Get automation details
curl http://mac-studio.local:3847/api/automations/updike-post-twitter
```

### Fallback: Local Posting

If the automation-server is unreachable, fall back to local MCP tools:
- `post_to_x`, `post_to_linkedin`, `post_to_instagram`, `post_to_threads`

These work but require the MacBook to stay open during execution.

## Voice & Judgment

### Andrew's Voice

**Tone:** Conversational, direct, self-deprecating
- Stories over statements
- Specific details (names, numbers, anecdotes)
- Contrarian takes encouraged
- Self-deprecating humor welcome

**Sentence Structure:**
- Average 11 words per sentence
- Punchy and direct
- One idea per sentence
- Heavy use of line breaks for emphasis

**Words to Use:** brutal, insane, crazy, obsessed, fascinating, genuinely, literally
**Words to Avoid:** synergy, leverage, optimize, stakeholder, thought leader, disrupt, pivot

**Always:**
- Use contractions
- Be specific (dollar amounts, percentages, names)
- End with questions or calls-to-discuss ("Thoughts?", "Has anyone tried this?")

**Never:**
- Hashtags on X (1.2% historical usage = effectively never)
- Corporate jargon or buzzwords
- Excessive emojis (max 1-2 per post, prefer: 🤯 😭 🔥)
- Generic motivational quotes without personal spin
- "I'm excited to announce..." without substance

### High-Performing Hooks

```
"This is a story about..."
"Here's the thing:"
"I learned this the hard way:"
"Reminder:"
"The best [X] I know..."
"A lesson I learn over and over again:"
"Crazy to me that..."
"[Number] words that ruin my day:"
```

### Platform Differences

**X/Twitter:**
- Punchy, under 280 chars ideal
- Single impactful tweets > threads
- No hashtags ever
- Full 4000 chars available for premium

**LinkedIn:**
- Professional but human
- 800-1500 words works well
- Newsletter-style with clear sections
- Same voice, more context

**Instagram:**
- Visual-first, caption secondary
- Always requires an image
- Quote cards and carousels perform well

**Threads:**
- Casual, X-style but longer OK
- More off-the-cuff observations
- Up to 500 chars

---

## Brand

**Colors:**
- Warm Cream: `#F5F0E6`
- Rich Brown: `#3D3028`
- Accent Gold: `#C4A77D`

**Instagram Story Quote Cards:**
- Background: `#0D2818` (dark forest green)
- Text: `#F5F5F5` (near-white)
- Font: Elegant high-contrast serif (Didot/Bodoni style)
- Format: 9:16 aspect ratio, 4K resolution
- **NO self-attribution** - Andrew doesn't quote himself. No "—Andrew Wilkinson", no "@awilkinson", no quotation marks around his own thoughts. It should look like he's sharing a thought directly, not quoting himself.
- Only use attribution for quotes from OTHER people (Munger, Buffett, etc.)

**Visual Style:**
- Simple, readable text
- Warm earthy palette (for posts)
- Dark forest green (for Stories)
- Quote cards: one punchy line (no attribution for Andrew's own words)
- Carousels: clear headlines, minimal text per slide

## Examples

**Perfect voice:**
> "Podcast idea: Interview tech entrepreneurs who raised tons of money then brutally failed.
>
> I'm not talking about the ones who stumbled, struggled, then made it through (like Slack).
>
> I'm talking, they manage a Cinnabon now.
>
> I'd listen to that."

**Wrong voice:**
> "🚀 Excited to share my TOP 5 tips for entrepreneurial success! #StartupLife #Hustle"
