## Fallback System: Never Empty Ad Slots

### The Problem
Empty ad slots look unprofessional and waste valuable real estate.

### The Solution: 3-Tier Fallback System

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  TIER 1: Paid Advertiser                                        │
│  ↓ (if no paid ad booked)                                       │
│  TIER 2: Goodwill Partners (local businesses you want to help)  │
│  ↓ (if no partners available)                                   │
│  TIER 3: House Ads (self-promotion)                             │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

---

### Tier 1: Paid Advertisers
Check Beehiiv for booked placements. If filled, use paid ad.

---

### Tier 2: Goodwill Partners (Fallback Inventory)

**File:** `data/goodwill-partners.json`

A rotating list of local businesses you want to promote for free when slots are unfilled. Benefits:
- Builds relationships with potential future advertisers
- Keeps newsletter looking full and professional
- Supports community businesses
- Creates social proof ("Look who advertises with us")

```json
{
  "partners": [
    {
      "name": "Ottavio Italian Bakery",
      "category": "restaurant",
      "tagline": "Oak Bay's favourite bakery since 1991",
      "description": "Fresh bread, pastries, and the best cappuccino on the Avenue.",
      "cta": "Visit them at 2272 Oak Bay Ave",
      "url": "https://ottavio.ca",
      "last_featured": null,
      "priority": 1
    },
    {
      "name": "Oak Bay Bikes",
      "category": "retail",
      "tagline": "Your neighbourhood bike shop",
      "description": "Sales, service, and rentals. Family-owned since 2005.",
      "cta": "Drop by for a tune-up",
      "url": "https://oakbaybikes.com",
      "last_featured": null,
      "priority": 2
    }
  ],
  "rotation_rules": {
    "min_gap_days": 14,
    "prioritize_never_featured": true,
    "category_balance": true
  }
}
```

**Rotation Logic:**
1. Pick partner not featured in last 14 days
2. Prioritize those never featured
3. Balance categories (don't show 3 restaurants in a row)
4. Mark `last_featured` after use

**Goodwill Partner Ad Format:**

### House Ad Rotation Logic

**File:** `data/house-ads.json`

```json
{
  "house_ads": [
    {
      "id": "sell-ad-slot",
      "type": "acquisition",
      "priority": 1,
      "content": {...},
      "last_used": null,
      "use_count": 0
    },
    {
      "id": "sister-pub-capital",
      "type": "cross-promo",
      "priority": 2,
      "content": {...}
    },
    {
      "id": "referral",
      "type": "growth",
      "priority": 3,
      "content": {...}
    },
    {
      "id": "tip-line",
      "type": "engagement",
      "priority": 4,
      "content": {...}
    }
  ],
  "rotation_rules": {
    "prioritize_acquisition": true,
    "max_same_ad_per_month": 2,
    "balance_types": true
  }
}
```

**Rotation Logic:**
1. Prioritize "sell the slot" ads (acquisition)
2. Don't show same house ad more than 2x/month
3. Rotate through types for variety

### Slot-Specific Fallback Rules

| Slot | Tier 1 | Tier 2 Fallback | Tier 3 Fallback |
|------|--------|-----------------|-----------------|
| Primary Sponsor | Paid sponsor | Goodwill partner (premium) | "This could be you" |
| Featured Event | Paid event | Community event highlight | Sister pub event |
| Business Spotlight | Paid spotlight | Goodwill partner | Referral program |
| Mid-Newsletter | Paid native ad | Goodwill partner | Cross-promo |
| Poll Sponsor | Paid sponsor | None (just unsponsored) | Tip line CTA |
| Job Listing | Paid job | Municipality job (free) | "Hiring? Post here" |
| Classifieds | Paid classified | None (skip section) | Community CTA |

### Implementation in /write Command

Add to `.claude/commands/write.md`:

```markdown
## Ad Slot Filling Logic

For each ad slot in the newsletter:

1. **Check Beehiiv** for paid placements booked for today
   - If found: Use paid ad content
   - If not: Continue to fallback

2. **Check Goodwill Partners** (`data/goodwill-partners.json`)
   - Find partner not featured in last 14 days
   - Match to appropriate slot type
   - If found: Use as "Neighbour Spotlight"
   - If not: Continue to fallback

3. **Use House Ad** (`data/house-ads.json`)
   - Select appropriate house ad for slot
   - Rotate to avoid repetition
   - Mark as used

4. **Log the decision** for analytics:
   - Which slot
   - What was used (paid/goodwill/house)
   - Why (no booking, rotation, etc.)
```

### Clever Self-Promotion Copy

**For Primary Sponsor slot:**
> "This prime spot could feature YOUR business. 2,000 neighbours are waiting to meet you. [Sponsor next week's edition →]"

**For Featured Event slot:**
> "Got an event coming up? Get it in front of every Oak Bay household. Featured events start at $50. [Promote your event →]"

**For Business Spotlight:**
> "New to Oak Bay? Just opened? Let your neighbours know you're here. [Get featured →]"

**For Mid-Newsletter:**
> "Real estate. Home services. Restaurants. Whatever you're selling, we've got neighbours buying. [Advertise with us →]"
