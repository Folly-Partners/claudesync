├── Thumbtacks: Red, blue, green, yellow circles with shadow
├── Shadows: Soft drop shadow on each "pinned" note
├── Fonts:

│   └── Body: System sans-serif for readability
├── Borders: Slightly torn/rough edges on some cards
└── Engagement: "💬 X neighbours responded" shows FB comment count
```

### Facebook Scraping Logic

Each week during `/research`:

1. **Scrape Oak Bay Local Facebook group** (last 7 days)
2. **Classify posts by category:**
   - Keywords: "ISO", "looking for", "anyone know" → Looking For
   - Keywords: "for sale", "selling", "$", "OBO" → For Sale
   - Keywords: "lost", "found", "missing" → Lost & Found
   - Keywords: "recommend", "suggestion", "good [service]" → Recs Wanted
   - Keywords: "garage sale", "estate sale", "moving sale" → Sales
   - Keywords: "hiring", "job", "position", "looking for staff" → Jobs
3. **Filter for high engagement:**
   - Prioritize posts with 3+ comments/likes
   - Skip posts older than 7 days
   - Skip posts that are just complaints/rants
4. **Extract for bulletin board:**
   - Author first name + last initial + neighbourhood
   - Truncated text (50-75 words max)
   - Comment count for "💬 X responded"
   - Original post URL for "Reply →" link

### Pricing Model

| Placement | Price | What They Get |
|-----------|-------|---------------|
| Featured Bulletin Spot | $49 | Photo, full description, top placement, 1 week |
| Service Provider Listing | $49 | Recurring weekly spot, professional card |
| Garage/Estate Sale Boost | $29 | Featured for 1 week, includes map link |

**How it works (Beehiiv behind the scenes):**
1. User clicks "Pin it to the board" → goes to Beehiiv storefront
2. Pays $49 via Beehiiv checkout
3. Submits photo + description via Beehiiv's ad creation flow
4. Claude checks Beehiiv for paid placements during `/write`
5. Paid placements get ⭐ FEATURED spot with photo

### Revenue Projection

| Scenario | Paid Spots/Week | Annual |
|----------|-----------------|--------|
| Conservative | 0.5 | $1,274 |
| Moderate | 1 | $2,548 |
| Optimistic | 2 | $5,096 |

*Plus organic engagement value: Readers come back for the bulletin board content*

## Fallback System: Never Empty Ad Slots

### The Problem
Empty ad slots look unprofessional and waste valuable real estate.

### The Solution: 3-Tier Fallback System

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  TIER 1: Paid Advertiser                                        │
│  ↓ (if no paid ad booked)                                       │
│  TIER 2: Goodwill Partners (local businesses you want to help)  │
│  ↓ (if no partners available)                                   │
│  TIER 3: House Ads (self-promotion)                             │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

---

### Tier 1: Paid Advertisers
Check Beehiiv for booked placements. If filled, use paid ad.

---

### Tier 2: Goodwill Partners (Fallback Inventory)

**File:** `data/goodwill-partners.json`

A rotating list of local businesses you want to promote for free when slots are unfilled. Benefits:
- Builds relationships with potential future advertisers
- Keeps newsletter looking full and professional
- Supports community businesses
- Creates social proof ("Look who advertises with us")

  "rotation_rules": {
    "min_gap_days": 14,
    "prioritize_never_featured": true,
    "category_balance": true
  }
}
```

**Rotation Logic:**
1. Pick partner not featured in last 14 days
2. Prioritize those never featured
3. Balance categories (don't show 3 restaurants in a row)
4. Mark `last_featured` after use

### House Ad Rotation Logic

**File:** `data/house-ads.json`

```json
{
  "house_ads": [
    {
      "id": "sell-ad-slot",
      "type": "acquisition",
      "priority": 1,
      "content": {...},
      "last_used": null,
      "use_count": 0
    },
    {
      "id": "sister-pub-capital",
      "type": "cross-promo",
      "priority": 2,
      "content": {...}
    },
    {
      "id": "referral",
      "type": "growth",
      "priority": 3,
      "content": {...}
    },
    {
      "id": "tip-line",
      "type": "engagement",
      "priority": 4,
      "content": {...}
    }
  ],
  "rotation_rules": {
    "prioritize_acquisition": true,
    "max_same_ad_per_month": 2,
    "balance_types": true
  }
}
```

**Rotation Logic:**
1. Prioritize "sell the slot" ads (acquisition)
2. Don't show same house ad more than 2x/month
3. Rotate through types for variety

---

### Slot-Specific Fallback Rules

| Slot | Tier 1 | Tier 2 Fallback | Tier 3 Fallback |
|------|--------|-----------------|-----------------|
| Primary Sponsor | Paid sponsor | Goodwill partner (premium) | "This could be you" |
| Featured Event | Paid event | Community event highlight | Sister pub event |
| Business Spotlight | Paid spotlight | Goodwill partner | Referral program |
| Mid-Newsletter | Paid native ad | Goodwill partner | Cross-promo |
| Bulletin Board | Paid featured ($49) | Facebook group posts (free, incl. jobs) | "Pin to the board" CTA |

---

### Implementation in /write Command

Add to `.claude/commands/write.md`:

```markdown
## Ad Slot Filling Logic

For each ad slot in the newsletter:

1. **Check Beehiiv** for paid placements booked for today
   - If found: Use paid ad content
   - If not: Continue to fallback

2. **Check Goodwill Partners** (`data/goodwill-partners.json`)
   - Find partner not featured in last 14 days
   - Match to appropriate slot type
   - If found: Use as "Neighbour Spotlight"
   - If not: Continue to fallback

3. **Use House Ad** (`data/house-ads.json`)
   - Select appropriate house ad for slot
   - Rotate to avoid repetition
   - Mark as used

4. **Log the decision** for analytics:
   - Which slot
   - What was used (paid/goodwill/house)
   - Why (no booking, rotation, etc.)
```

---

### Clever Self-Promotion Copy

**For Primary Sponsor slot:**
> "This prime spot could feature YOUR business. 2,000 neighbours are waiting to meet you. [Sponsor next week's edition →]"

**For Featured Event slot:**
> "Got an event coming up? Get it in front of every Oak Bay household. Featured events start at $50. [Promote your event →]"

**For Business Spotlight:**
> "New to Oak Bay? Just opened? Let your neighbours know you're here. [Get featured →]"

**For Mid-Newsletter:**
> "Real estate. Home services. Restaurants. Whatever you're selling, we've got neighbours buying. [Advertise with us →]"

---
