## Email 2: Zol Peterson - Creatine Science

**To:** zolpeterson@gmail.com
**Subject:** Creatine During Pregnancy - Research Summary

---

Hi Zol,

Here's a breakdown of the science on creatine supplementation during pregnancy:

**The Research:**

1. **2025 Taylor & Francis Study** - Found maternal creatine supplementation safe during healthy, term pregnancies. Provides foundation for potential therapeutic use.

2. **NIH/PubMed Central (2014)** - "No harmful effects of maternal creatine treatment on mother or neonate" observed in studies.

3. **Hudson Institute Research** - Supplementing maternal diet during pregnancy "improved the likelihood of having a healthy baby at birth."

4. **Animal Studies** - Rats given 1% creatine supplementation for 10 days prior to delivery showed improved morphological outcomes in offspring.

**Why It Might Help:**

Creatine is recognized as a "critical cellular energy metabolite for pregnancy." The theory is that it supports the high energy demands of fetal development and may protect against birth complications, particularly related to oxygen deprivation.

**Key Sources:**
- https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/15502783.2025.2533674
- https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4007139/
- https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7912953/
- https://hudson.org.au/news/creatine-and-pregnancy-what-you-need-to-know/

**Bottom Line:** Current research supports safety in healthy pregnancies with potential benefits. As always, recommend discussing with healthcare provider for personalized advice.

Let me know if you want me to dig deeper into anything!

## Email 3: Ben Allard - Acquisition Interest

**To:** benallard@coquitlamconcrete.com
**Subject:** Quick question about Coquitlam Concrete

---

Hey Ben,

I'm Andrew Wilkinson - I run a holding company called Tiny out of Victoria. We buy and hold great businesses for the long term.

I was doing some research on family businesses in BC and came across Coquitlam Concrete. Really impressive that your family has been at it since 1945 - that's almost 80 years of building something meaningful.

I'm not sure if you've ever thought about what's next for the business, but if you're ever open to exploring options, I'd love to grab a coffee and hear more about how you've built it. No pressure at all - just figured it was worth reaching out.

Either way, happy to connect if you're ever in Victoria.

## Email 4: Keaka Robinson - Maui Linen Acquisition

**To:** hlskeaka@aol.com
**Subject:** Coffee while I'm on Maui?

---

Hi Keaka,

I'm Andrew Wilkinson - I run a holding company called Tiny that acquires and operates great businesses long-term.

I'm in Maui until January 8th and came across Maui Linen Supply. Being the largest commercial laundry on the island serving the hospitality industry is impressive - that's a hard business to build.

I'd love to buy you a coffee while I'm here and learn more about the business. Not sure if you've ever thought about what's next, but if you're ever open to exploring options, I'd be interested in talking.

No pressure either way - just thought it was worth reaching out while I'm on the island.

Best,

Andrew Wilkinson

## Email 5: Guy Le Monnier - Ambrosia Acquisition

**To:** info@ambrosiabanquet.ca
**Subject:** Question about Ambrosia Banquet & Events

---

Hi Guy,

I'm Andrew Wilkinson - I run Tiny, a holding company based here in Victoria that acquires and operates businesses for the long term.

I've been a fan of what you've done with Ambrosia since taking over in 2012. The combination of the banquet hall and Island Gourmet Catering is a smart setup, and the venue at Ashlar Manor is beautiful.

I wanted to reach out to see if you've ever considered what the future of the business might look like. If you're ever open to a conversation about potential options, I'd love to grab a coffee and hear more about how you've built it.

No pressure at all - just figured it was worth reaching out since we're both in Victoria.

Best,

Andrew Wilkinson
