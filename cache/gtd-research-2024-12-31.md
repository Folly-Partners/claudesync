Recent research supports creatine supplementation during pregnancy as safe and potentially beneficial. A 2025 Taylor & Francis study found maternal creatine supplementation safe during healthy, term pregnancies. PubMed Central research shows no harmful effects on mother or neonate.

## 32. AI Meeting Summary Accuracy Issues
**Things ID:** `Ts64XY4ANG2oHpTxgdHZFD`

### Key Findings
AI transcription and meeting summaries have significant accuracy problems:
- **Whisper (OpenAI):** AP News reports researchers found hallucinations in hospitals using this tool; one developer found hallucinations in nearly every one of 26,000 transcripts
- **Hallucination rates:** Rev.com study shows heavy AI users see 3x more hallucinations
- **Clinical context:** 2025 research framework found errors classified as: omissions, factual inaccuracies, or hallucinations
- **Definition:** AI hallucinations are "inaccurate outputs that appear plausible but contain false information"
- **Risk:** Errors in clinical documentation can lead to inaccurate recording and communication of facts
